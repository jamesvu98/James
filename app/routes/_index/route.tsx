              , working on building and maintaining our developer platform. I
              started my career in data analytics which was where I first got
              exposed to working with AWS and cloud technologies. As a Platform
              Engineer working closely with other Software Engineers, I soon
              started to develop an interest in web development. The purpose of
              this site (and any other projects that may feature here) is to be
              an avenue where I can develop my skills in the technologies that I
              may not have much opportunity to work with during my day-to-day as
              a Platform Engineer.
